<h2>Optics laboratory</h2>
</header>
<p>Online physics courses need online laboratories.&nbsp; Here we are developing 
tools for optics laboratories.&nbsp; Students will be able to move components on an 
optical breadboard, align the components, trace a He-Ne laser beam through the 
system and make measurement.&nbsp; The app is under development and you can 
explore the first steps.</p>
<h4>Experiment 1:&nbsp; Reflection and refraction</h4>
<p>You are presented with a He-Ne laser, an optical breadboard and several 
optical components.&nbsp;&nbsp; The components can be dragged to different 
positions on the breadboard and the components can snap to the holes on the 
breadboard which have a spacing of 1 unit = 2.5 cm.&nbsp; The screen is 4 units 
wide and 2 units high and the lines on the screen are spaced by &frac12; unit.&nbsp; 
Clicking anywhere on the breadboard you can rotate and zoom the view. Currently, you can steer the laser beam onto a target in three dimensions 
using two mirrors.&nbsp; A transparent viewer can help you align the beam.&nbsp; 
All components can be translated and rotated, post holders can be raised and 
lowered, and mirrors can be tilted up and down with the mouse. (Touch has not 
yet been enabled.)&nbsp; You can measure the index of refraction of a glass 
block with dimensions of 2.8 by 2.8 by 1.4 units. </p>

<h4>Experiment 2:&nbsp; Diffraction and Interference</h4>
<p>A He-Ne laser beam (&#955; = 633 nm) produces Fraunhofer diffraction and 
interference pattern that you can observe on a screen. You can drag four 
different slides into the the of the laser beam, and you can vary the slide to 
screen distance.&nbsp; Clicking anywhere on the breadboard you can rotate and 
zoom the view.&nbsp; The screen and the slides snap to the holes on the 
breadboard which have a spacing of 1 unit = 2.5 cm.&nbsp; The screen is 4 units 
wide and 2 units high and the lines on the screen are spaced by &frac12; unit.<br>
Three of the slides block all the light except for a 
single w = 20 &#956;m wide slit, or two or four w = 20 &#956;m wide slits with slit 
spacing d.&nbsp; From the observed patterns you can verify the slit width w and 
determine the slit spacing d.&nbsp; The only thing blocking the laser light on a 
fourth slide is a hair.&nbsp; You can measure the width of the hair using the 
diffraction pattern produced by the laser light.</p>
<p>The lines on the slides are not drawn to scale.&nbsp; Their purpose is just 
to identify the slides.&nbsp; The most intense regions of the diffraction and 
interference patterns always have the same maximum color intensity allowed by 
the computer graphics.&nbsp; A realistic decrease in the color intensity with 
distance from the slit(s) would make the dimmer regions of the diffraction and 
interference patterns invisible at larger distances.&nbsp; That is a limitation 
of the computer graphics.</p>

<h4>Experiment 3:&nbsp; Polarization Lab</h4>
<p>The He-Ne laser beam (&#955; = 633 nm) is unpolarized.&nbsp; You have 3 (ideal) 
linear polarizers and a power meter with a Bluetooth connection to a digital 
readout to monitor the beam intensity.&nbsp; You can also monitor the intensity of the laser beam on a screen 
(corrected for the average response of the human eye to light).&nbsp; The polarizers are mounted in a rotation stage.&nbsp; The transmission axis of the 
polarizers is horizontal when the rotation stage reads zero.&nbsp; You can 
explore what happens to the transmitted intensity if you rotate a third 
polarizer between two crossed polarizers and you can verify the Law of Malus.&nbsp; 
You can also reflect the laser beam off a glass slide and explore polarization 
by reflection.&nbsp; The back of the glass slide is painted black to absorb the 
transmitted portion of the beam.&nbsp; The slide is made of high-index of 
refraction glass, you can measure the index of refraction by finding the&nbsp; 
the Brewster angle.</p>

<h4>Experiment 4: Image formation and point aberrations (parallel beam)</h4>
<p>Determine the effective focal length of a bi-convex and two plano-convex 
lenses.&nbsp; The object is a beam (representing a point source at infinity).&nbsp; 
You can vary the aperture size by varying the beam radius.&nbsp; Use the mouse 
to move the lens and the screen along an optical rail and to zoom and rotate the 
view.&nbsp; The major unit of the scale on the track is cm.&nbsp; For large 
apertures, look for spherical aberrations and observe coma and astigmatism as you rotate the lens.&nbsp; For some lenses coma is the 
dominant aberration, while for others it is astigmatism. </p>
<p>Exact ray tracing equations for tick lenses are used. (Reference:

<h4>Experiment 5: Image formation and point aberrations (lamp with markings)</h4>
<p>Determine the effective focal length of a bi-convex and two plano-convex 
lenses.&nbsp; The object is a lamp with markings.&nbsp; 
Use the mouse 
to move the lamp, lens, and the screen along an optical rail and to zoom and 
rotate the view.&nbsp; The major unit of the scale on the track is cm.&nbsp; For 
large apertures, look for spherical aberrations and observe coma and astigmatism 
as you rotate the lens.&nbsp; </p>
